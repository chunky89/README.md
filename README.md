# CS50 Introduction-to-ComputerScience Final Poject

Professor [David Malan](http://cs.harvard.edu/malan/)

## About this course

Havard University introduces an entry level to experience the computing programming language taught By David J Malan. [Cs50 intro Computer Sciene Course found on this link here] (https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) 

This course teaches students about algorithms, using the programming languages includes C, Python, Javascript and HTML and so on and it is based on the problem solving a task how implement your coding skills.

There are nine porblems set, including a final project which students are expected to submit.

## Here are the task below, which I have implented through this project on the entry level of Computer Science and below are my projects that I have demonstrated my skills 
## On programming. This is my career path in becoming a Software Developer.
